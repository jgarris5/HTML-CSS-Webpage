         <h1>Facebook videos will now automatically play sound by default.</h1>

         <img src="img/facebook-img.jpg" alt="phone picture" />

         <p class="intro">Facebook announced a <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/02/new-ways-to-watch-facebook-video/" target="_blank">
           suite of new changes to its video platform today</a>,
             including a new setting that will autoplay videos with the sound turned on by default.
             This change means that, if your phone is not set to silent and you haven’t disabled
             the feature in Facebook’s mobile settings panel, every video in the News Feed will
             have audio fading in as you scroll past it. The switch from muting videos by default
             follows a multi-month testing period that first surfaced last August.</p>

             <p> Facebook clarified to The Verge that sound from its videos will not interrupt
                music from Apple Music, Spotify, or any other mobile audio source. Dan Rose, Facebook’s
                vice president of partnerships, also stressed that the company is trying not to be user-hostile
                 with the change. “We’re going to honor the sound settings on your phone,” he said today at
                 Recode’s Code Media conference. “If sound is on your phone, we’ll default to sound on
                 rather than off.”</p>

             <blockquote>You can turn off the autoplay sound feature in settings.
             </blockquote>

             <p>The change raises all sorts of questions, like whether unsuspecting
               Facebook users will be caught scrolling through the News Feed at a
               meeting or in class. “Well a few years ago when we started autoplay
               it was very new to people,” Rose said in response to potential pitfalls.
               “Now they’re pretty conscious” of how it works, he added. (In other words,
               make sure you set your phone to vibrate if you’re trying to sneak a peek
               at your feed in a sensitive situation.) Facebook says the feature can be
               turned off by toggling the “Videos in News Feed Start With Sound”
               option in the settings panel.</p>
